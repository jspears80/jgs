          Microsoft 365 is where your firm’s operation lives — client files, correspondence, deadlines, and trust.
          Over time, access drifts, policies weaken, and proof disappears. The Secure phase fixes that.
          These flat-fee projects close quiet gaps and rebuild your environment so it’s not just working — it’s defensible.

          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Most breaches don’t start with a genius attacker — they start with open access,
          forgotten settings, and missing visibility. The Security Retrofit closes those quiet entry points and replaces
          uncertainty with proof.

          <strong>Why it matters:</strong> When email is hijacked, spoofed, or quietly redirected, it isn’t a technical glitch —
